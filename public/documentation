Child-to-parent communication is a little more complicated. The standard way of doing this is to have the parent pass a function to the child through props. 
The child then calls this function at some point and passes it a value that the parent is supposed to react to. 
We then write the functionality for the parent's reaction inside the parent component.

still having a display issue because of how the app is setup.
two big problems:
switching from form to display weather leaves the form showing
switching from display weather back to form leaves display weather showing

some general ideas I've seen so far include
using location to skip around the navigation and only show one component

use CSS to hide components
