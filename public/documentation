Developing Components in Isolation
storybook for React or other 3rd party tools can allow you to see the individual states
within component



Child-to-parent communication is a little more complicated. The standard way of doing this is to have the parent pass a function to the child through props. 
The child then calls this function at some point and passes it a value that the parent is supposed to react to. 
We then write the functionality for the parent's reaction inside the parent component.

next thing I want to work on is adding in a location where people can search
for a city and get the api to make a new call out and get additional information
->
store data in some sort of local storage?

next things to work on is to get working on

errors:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
my component is being re-mounted for some reason.
it shouldn't be because it's a child -> confirm this.

//////////
currently working on:

got the secondary form to render correctly.
however because I am flipping fetchedweatherdata so often it is stopping me from rendering current weather
second error is the second form I am rendering shows <CurrentWeather> underneath because I am showing them together
next steps is to try and use a conditional statement to update this.
other idea for the navbar move it to be under <App>?

hard set fetchedweatherdata to be true under App and then add it as a props on form under navbar
