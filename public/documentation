Developing Components in Isolation
storybook for React or other 3rd party tools can allow you to see the individual states
within component



Child-to-parent communication is a little more complicated. The standard way of doing this is to have the parent pass a function to the child through props. 
The child then calls this function at some point and passes it a value that the parent is supposed to react to. 
We then write the functionality for the parent's reaction inside the parent component.

next thing I want to work on is adding in a location where people can search
for a city and get the api to make a new call out and get additional information
->
store data in some sort of local storage?

next things to work on is to get working on
React Router

I should break this down into more parts 


react switch components
-> moved data down to app
-> resolved api call out!
need to fix and resolve switching out components
=== found a method involving switch ===
got the switch function working with help from the internet.
currently trying to get the conditions to render correctly.
need to investigate into this more.

updated code on form so that when you onSubmit the form
this.setState updates fetchedWeatherData to be true.
this has now fixed the form being shown first.
what is still not working is the data from the form is not
being passed to <DisplayWeather>

updated Stackoverflow question and asked multiple times on the internet
update the state under <App> because the way I am currently trying to store
the values isn't working
==> will review this tomorrow.
